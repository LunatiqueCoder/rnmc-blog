#### React Native videoplayer with RN-media-console

In the world of React Native development, achieving smooth and engaging video playback is a game-changer. 
Whether you're building a social network, educational platform, or entertainment app, a seamless video experience is essential. 
The most popular and feature-rich library at the time of writing is `react-native-video`, boasting support for ads, subtitles, and various other functionalities. 
However, it's important to note that `react-native-video` lacks a unified set of controls seamlessly compatible between Android and iOS. It relies on basic native controls, 
leading to a fragmented user experience.

This is where `react-native-media-console` steps in. Built on top of `react-native-video`, it serves as a comprehensive video player, 
offering a seamless set of controls that harmoniously work across both Android and iOS platforms. With `react-native-media-console`, 
you can elevate your video interactions, ensuring a consistent and user-friendly experience.
